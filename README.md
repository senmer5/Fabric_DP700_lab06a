# üì¶  Load Data into a Warehouse using T-SQL

## üéØ Purpose of the Lab
This lab demonstrates how to ingest data from a lakehouse into a data warehouse using T-SQL in Microsoft Fabric. It covers the creation of schemas, tables, views, and a stored procedure to load and analyze sales data for large-scale analytics. The goal is to understand how data flows from a data lake to a structured warehouse environment and how SQL-based transformations enable deeper analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Process 

1. **Create a Fabric Workspace**
   - Logged into Microsoft Fabric and created a new workspace with Fabric trial or premium capacity.

2. **Set Up a Lakehouse and Upload Data**
   - Created a new lakehouse.
   - Downloaded the `sales.csv` file from GitHub.
   - Uploaded the CSV file to the Files folder in the lakehouse.

3. **Create a Table in the Lakehouse**
   - Loaded the uploaded CSV file into a new table named `staging_sales` using Fabric‚Äôs built-in table loading feature.

4. **Create a Data Warehouse**
   - Created a new data warehouse in the same workspace.

5. **Create Fact and Dimension Tables**
   - Created the following tables under a new schema named `Sales`:
     - `Fact_Sales`
     - `Dim_Customer`
     - `Dim_Item`
   - Defined primary keys (non-enforced) on the dimension tables.

6. **Create a View**
   - Created a view named `Staging_Sales` in the warehouse that queries the lakehouse `staging_sales` table directly.

7. **Load Data from Staging to Warehouse**
   - Developed and executed a stored procedure `Sales.LoadDataFromStaging` to:
     - Populate `Dim_Customer` and `Dim_Item` with distinct values.
     - Load transactional data into `Fact_Sales`.

8. **Run Analytical Queries**
   - Ran three analytical queries to:
     - Find top customers by total sales.
     - Find best-selling items.
     - Determine the top customer in each category (Bike, Helmet, Gloves).

## üìò What I Learned

- **Workspace & Lakehouse Integration**: Learned how Microsoft Fabric integrates lakehouse and warehouse architectures within the same environment.
  
- **Data Ingestion**: Gained hands-on experience in uploading and preparing CSV files for analysis using lakehouse tables.

- **Warehouse Modeling**: Understood dimensional modeling by creating fact and dimension tables.

- **View & Cross-Database Querying**: Learned how to use views to bridge data between lakehouse and warehouse, enabling cross-storage querying.

- **Stored Procedures**: Practiced writing and executing stored procedures with parameters for dynamic data loading.

- **Analytical Insights**: Developed T-SQL skills by writing aggregate queries to extract insights from warehouse data.

- **Performance Considerations**: Understood the trade-offs of using or skipping foreign key constraints in data warehousing for performance optimization.

This lab provided a comprehensive end-to-end scenario that connects data ingestion, modeling, transformation, and analytics ‚Äî all using T-SQL in Microsoft Fabric.
